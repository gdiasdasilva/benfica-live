<a href="#" target="_blank">benfica.live</a> is a platform created to gather data that otherwise would be too dispersed.

In this platform, Sport Lisboa e Benfica's fans can share spots to assist to the matches while abroad.

We're trying to use the most recent technologies and standards.

Current stack:

* Laravel 5
* Vue.js
* Sass

Feel free to give us feedback and/or contribute directly to the project! Beit on the frontend or backend.
